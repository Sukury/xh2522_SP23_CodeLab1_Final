# The Project is too large so I export it as a unitypackage 

This is a self-shopping mini game

some issue need to be fixed is that when drag the product to scan in the scan area, it is hard to click on the product and drag them out. I think it is because of the multiple collider and on mouse click event issue, I will try to fix it later.
